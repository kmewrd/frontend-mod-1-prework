## Section 1 Reflection

### 1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I thought the article was great. My main takeaways were to stay curious, ask questions, share knowledge, and take care of yourself. I feel like I already read a lot. I have a habit of falling down the rabbit hole with topics that interest me. I also feel like explaining a concept to someone else is a great way to check if you understand it yourself. If you can't explain it very well, it probably means you don't fully understand what you're talking about. I'll try to do this more often - I've already talked to my partner about teaching him new ideas. I will also try to force myself to take more breaks. I've heard of the benefits before, but I always used the excuse that I don't have time for breaks, which is not a good mindset to have. I don't think that asking questions was explicitly stated, but it should be on the list.

### 2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

* A __number__ is a data type that handles all numbers, including negative numbers, decimals, etc.
* A __string__ is a data type that handles letters and special characters. It is enclosed by quotation marks, which can be single or double as long as they are the same type.
* A __boolean__ is a data type that means true or false. It is helpful for letting your computer or browser know what set of instructions to fall. If yes, do this set of tasks; if no, do nothing.

### 3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

```javascript
console.log("Hello World!");
```

### 4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

For `single line comments`, you would use two back slashes, like this.

```JavaScript
//This is a comment
```

For `comment blocks` that are more descriptive and span multiple lines, you would enclose the comments in a back slash and an asterisk.

```JavaScript
/* This is an example
of a longer comment
that spans multiple lines. */
```

### 5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is something that can store information and be used or referenced multiple times throughout a block of code. It's like a placeholder. It contains information. If I was explaining it to a 5 year old, I would say that a variable is like a code word. When you say the code word, the person you're talking to knows that you mean a specific thing. This is so you don't have to say that specific thing multiple times, especially if it's a long name.

### 6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

I use a banking app frequently. At the top of the dashboard, it says "Hello, Kimberly." It also displays my account name and my account balance. The variables it probably uses are name, accountName, and accountBalance. The first two are strings while the last one could be a number or a string.

### 7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is the method of combining multiple variables into one thing. These variables can be different data types, such as strings and numbers. In JavaScript you use a plus sign to add combine these.

### 8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

I use a Microsoft application called Teams almost daily at my job. In the Chat area, if you're scrolled up through your messages and you receive a message, a little pop-up will appear that says "You have 1 new message" or something like that. This would be an example of concatenation, where the devs declared a variable for number of new messages and has the application print out "You have ${numberOfMessages} new message" in the Chat.

### 9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

Do phone applications use JavaScript? What about HTML and CSS, are those browser-specific languages?  
Can you reassign a variable from one data type to another? I would assume the answer is yes.  
I know that JavaScript is used for fillable fields on a website. It's also used for variables that are displayed to the user, such as a username or heading at the top of a page that says "Hello, Name!" What else can JavaScript do?
