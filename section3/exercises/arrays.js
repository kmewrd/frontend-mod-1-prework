//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals[2] = "Gorilla";
// Used console.log(animals[2]); to check work

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals.push("Meerkat");
// Used console.log(animals); to check work

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
animals[2] = "Elephant";
console.log(animals[2]);
console.log(animals);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = [""];
foods = ["bananas", "raspberries", "grapes", "cantaloupes", "limes"];

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(foods.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
foods.push("broccoli");
console.log(foods);
// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
foods.pop();
console.log(foods);
// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
foods.unshift("oranges", "plums", "peaches");
console.log(foods);
// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
foods.shift(0);
// used console.log(foods); to check work
//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: Airbnb - Lists potential stays that fit a number of criteria defined by the user.
// 2: The Modern Proper (Recipe blog) - Any blog stores a list of posts that are associated with one
// writer or account.
// 3: Spotify - Lists of songs are arranged by artist, in playlists, in suggested stations, etc.

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
They can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here
// This line states that if the value of percentBatteryLeft is greater than or equal to 15,
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
// the console will log the string "You can call an Uber."
  console.log("You can call an Uber.")
// This line will execute if the previous conditional evaluates to false. It says that if the value of
// hasCharger is exactly equal to true, AND chargerType is exactly equal to the string "car",
} else if (hasCharger === true && chargerType === "car") {
// the console will log the string "You can call an Uber."
  console.log("You can call an Uber.");
// If none of the above conditionals evaluate to true,
} else {
// the console will log the string "You cannot call an Uber."
  console.log("You cannot call an Uber.");
}

// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
