## Section 3 Reflection

### 1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

Believing that you can improve your skills with effort and practice was a big one for me. In school, I got used to feeling like things just "clicked" for me, and I would often be discouraged from pursuing interests or developing skills that did not come naturally. I think that a willingness to learn and appreciation of the process will be essential for my own growth. This also ties in nicely with another point, which is that if you give up, you won't learn anything. By following a difficult problem, no matter where it leads you, you're bound to learn something in the process.

### 1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I think that one thing I'm good at is setting goals and doing my best to follow through. A thing I'm not good at, however, is seeking out challenges that push the limits of my capabilities. I tend to stop at the boundary of my comfort zone. This is something I need to work on!

### 1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

I keep going back to the example of Airbnb because it was mentioned in the Mod 0 prework. When you enter a set of criteria into the search bar - for example Location: Bentonville, AR, Dates: Oct 15 - 18, and Guests: 2 - and hit search, it displays the information you just searched at the top of the list of results. It displays like this: 189 stays · Oct 15 - 18 · 2 guests. This could be an example of an array.

### 1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method is an action that can be performed upon an array. These methods may add or subtract values, such as strings,  to an array.

### 1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

A loop is a way to instruct your code to execute a function or action multiple times without manually typing it out multiple times. This way, you can write the code for that particular function or action once. Your loop will evaluate your code and if it returns true, it will continue repeat the code until it returns false or until it has run a certain number of loops that you specify.

You will use a loop in conjunction with an array if you want your code to perform an action on multiple items within the same list. If you only need your code to perform an action on one item, you would not need an array.

### 1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

A loop is basically the way that you tell your code to go through series of steps, over and over again, until you get a different result that tells you to stop the loop. An example would be if I said to get ready for school. The steps, or conditions, that you need to answer would be: Is your hair messy? Are your teeth unbrushed? Are your shoes still in the closet? Until all of these questions are answered with no, you would need to go back and perform that step in the series again. You would do this as many times as it takes until the answer is no for all of them.

### 1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

What happens if you create an infinite loop within a file on your computer? Besides counters (and maybe password authentication), what other real-life applications can loops be used for?
